## Grading

## Assignment: Solo Game

This is your first long-term project. You will be creating a one-player game in which a user interacts with the console.

Make sure you **review the document on Google Classroom** before starting this assignment.  

All your responses to these questions will be answered on the document on Google Classroom

### Step 1: Choose your game.

Some suggestions include:

* Number guessing game
* [Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs)
* [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))
* Mental math game
* Trivia game
* Word guessing game
* [Math problem solving game](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vEsXHTvMq4tSr3h6YQWwYdRdJD8EJseD_WfN2knJjh4/edit?usp=sharing) (do not choose a game with a graphics component)

If you are choosing a different type of game, be sure to check with your teacher first.

### Step 2: Plan your game.

Answer the following questions on the Google Classroom document.

1. How does your game work?
2. How long do you think it will take to write all the code for this game?
3. What do you think will be the most challenging part of creating this game?
4. If you happen to finish early, what other features could you try to add to the game to make it better?

# BEFORE YOU START CODING
SHOW YOUR PLAN TO YOUR TEACHER FOR THEM TO SIGN OFF ON IT!

### Step 3: Begin coding your game.

Begin writing the code for your game in **main.py**. Ensure that your program has line comments to explain your thinking and your code includes ALL of the following:

* `print()`
* `input()`
* At least one of:
  * `=`, `+=`, `-=`,`*=`, or`/=`
* at least one string
* at least one integer or a float
* At least one of:
  * `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`
* At least one of:
  * `if`, `elif`, or `else` 
* At least one of:
  * `for` or `while`
* At least one of:
  * `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, or `>=`
* At least one of:
  * `and`, `or`, or `not`

**Optional:** 
* If you want to add more complexity to your game, you are welcome to use the [Python Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/) to learn things we haven't seen yet. **Do not** use graphics libraries such as Pygame, Tkinter, and Turtle.
 * If you are using the `curses` library you don't need to include `print()` and `input()`.

See your teacher so you can be set up with a partner.

### Step 4: Test your game.

You will be assigned a classmate who will test out your game and give you feedback. You will also test our their game and give them feedback.

When giving feedback, you are encouraged to answer the following prompts:

* What parts of the program/game were done well?
* What parts of the program/game could use improvement?
* What do you wish the program/game included?

Modify your code based on their feedback.

### Step 5: Acknowledge your sources.

In **sources.md**, put links to ALL of the online resources you used. In your program, be sure you have line comments to indicate which parts of your program are copy/pasted from the Internet.

### Step 6: Reflection.

Answer the following questions on the Google Classroom document.

1. What did you enjoy about this project?

2. What did you not enjoy about this project?

3. Describe some of the strategies you used to overcome challenges and difficulties when writing your program.

4. Were there any features you planned on including but eventually decided not to include? If so, what were they?

5. If you were to redo this project, what would you do differently?

6. If you had more experience programming, what would you do to make this game better?

7. Would you like to come back to this project later? Why or why not?
